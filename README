Helper to open files referenced in ReStructuredText directives (image/figure/include). If text/file does not exist then will be added/created. Opening is possible with go to position of the file (via line number or pattern options in the directive) or not. Adding handlers of other directives is simple.

So, current version supports ".. include::" with ":start-line:", ":start-after:" options (to jump) and ".. image::", ".. figure::" directives.

Default key bindings are:
,gf - simple open existent file
,gF - forced open (create, jump to position in the file)

Settings are:
RSTO_imgopen - path (+ arguments) to exe file to open image
RSTO_imgnew - path (+ arguments) to exe file to create nonexistent image
g:RSTO_handlers - only to add own directives' handlers!

Good luck!
